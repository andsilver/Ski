Feature:
  In order to feature my new development on the new developments page
  As a property developer or estate agent
  I want to flag my property for sale as a new development
  In order to find a new development to buy
  As a property buyer
  I want to view a page that shows only new developments

  Scenario Outline: Property developers, estate agents and administrators see
  new development checkbox on the new property page
    Given I am signed in as a <role>
    When I am on the new property page
    Then I should see "New development"

    Examples:
    | role               |
    | property developer |
    | estate agent       |
    | administrator      |

  Scenario Outline: Advertisers who are neither property developers nor estate
  agents do not see the new property development checkbox
    Given I am signed in as a <role>
    When I am on the new property page
    Then I should not see "New development"

    Examples:
    | role           |
    | property owner |
