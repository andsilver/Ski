# CMS User Guide

## Resizing Images

Get IrfanView from http://www.irfanview.com/

Open images in IrfanView

Use Image > Scale (or Resize) image

Save a copy of the image (Save As) as a .jpg

## Naming Files

The web server is case sensitive: CHALET.jpg is not the same as chalet.jpg

It is easier to always use lowercase.

Use hyphens instead of spaces.

Instead of: a chalet.jpg

Use: a-chalet.jpg

## HTML

You can create your own HTML files that give you free reign over style.

Create a file on your computer: test.html for example

Edit your file in NotePad++

You can put any HTML or CSS you like in here without affecting the
website.

Open the file on your computer with a web browser to preview your work.

Upload the file to the /public/ folder using FileZilla.

When you are happy you will need me to transfer it across and create
the styles to fit within the website.

## Promotion Codes

Create a new promotion code in CMS > Promotion Codes

Set the number of adverts to which the promotion code can apply (counted from
the first advert placed, regardless of whether it was discounted at the
time).

Set a percentage off. 100% is free.

Apply a promotion code by going to CMS > Users > Some User and changing the
applied promotion code in the drop down menu and then press save.

A promotion code will apply to any kind of advert and all promotion codes
appear in the same area. Prefixing the promotion code with a 'B' for banner
advert or a 'P' for property can aid in reminding what the promotion code
was intended for and also makes it easier to locate alphabetically in the
drop down list.

## Headers

Resort headers go in
/public/resorts/resort-name/headers

Summer holidays headers go in
/public/resorts/resort-name/summer-headers
