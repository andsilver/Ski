                      <p><strong>Ski holidays in Bernese Oberland</strong> - this is one of Switzerland’s most iconic cantons
                          that is
                          home to the world famous peaks of the Eiger, Jungfrau and Monch and accessed by the equally famous
                          resorts
                          of Grindelwald, Wengen and Mürren.</p>
                       <p>The Bernese Oberland covers the area south of Bern and extends as far south as Glacier 3000 on the
                          Vaud
                          border taking in the glitzy and ultra chic resort of Gstaad - the main competitor to St Moritz for
                          attracting the world's Royalty for their skiing holidays.</p>
                       <p>As a year-round destination, the Bernese Oberland offers outdoor adventures in the summer and snow
                          sports
                          during the winter months. With towering peaks, snow and ice, this Swiss canton is the ideal place
                          to relax,
                          have fun and enjoy the natural wonders.</p>
                       <p>The Bernese Oberland is also laced with hidden gems where many ski resorts are not even on the
                          radar, even
                          in
                          Switzerland! Hidden valleys off the beaten track cloak beautiful villages from the outside world
                          and are
                          waiting to be explored. The Kandertal and Gstaad Saanenland regions are a labyrinth of winding
                          roads
                          through
                          remote valleys. This is where you'll find tiny villages that link in to vast ski areas where ski
                          touring is
                          a
                          firm favourite.</p>

                      <p>The ski area enjoys exceptionally good snowfall from mid-November to the end of April, with an
                          average of
                          nearly 7m of powder every year.</p>
                      <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: green">Beginners</h2>
                      <p>The extent and variety of the beginner terrain across the Bernese Oberland ski resorts is superb.
                          From the Jungfrau Region resorts of Grindelwald and Wengen to the wide open slopes around Gstaad,
                          most resorts offer extensive beginner slopes with magic carpets and gentle lifts.</p>
                      <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: red">Intermediate</h2>
                      <p>The wealth of terrain means that intermediates will find plenty of suitable trails across many
                          Bernese Oberland resorts. The Jungfrau is the largest ski area but if you are thinking of a good
                          days tour, you can ski over to Ischgl on the Silvretta carousel in Austria from Sammaun.</p>
                      <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: #005e9c">Advanced</h2>
                      <p>Expert skiers are in for a treat in the Bernese Oberland as the high peaks provide some of
                          Switzerland's best steeps. From the glaciers and high trails around Jungfrau to the off-piste
                          touring around Gstaad, Mürren and Grindelwald, the Bernese Oberland certainly caters for the
                          extreme skiers and boarders. When you add in the heli-skiing opportunities on the 4000m peaks,
                          there is more terrain can you can cover in a lifetime.</p>

                  <h1>Best Things To See & Do</h1>
                  <p>The Bernese Oberland offers so much variety in terms of what do see and do for all ages. From day trips
                      to one of the nearby lakes to visting one of the valley towns such as Interlaken</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>A trip to the Bern, the capital of Switzerland and the gateway to the Bernese Oberland Alps is well
                      worth a visit. The city dates back to the 12th century and much of it's medieval architecture is in
                      tact making it an open air museum. The Aare Rive curls around three sides of the old town which is
                      where you will find shops, bars and restaurants tucked away along the winding cobbled streets.</p>

                      Europe. The journey takes you through the Eiger and Monch mountains to the perpetually snow covered
                      station. Here, you have panoramic views plus this is the gateway to the mighty Aletsch Glacier -
                      europe's longest stretching 23km - and the starting point of many ski tours.</p>

              <h1>Our view on Bernese Oberland ski resorts</h1>
              <br>
              <p>Bernese Oberland is a year round destination with warm summer months for hiking, mountain biking and
                  watersports whilst the winter is a mecca for snow sports. With 59 ski resorts dotted around the largest
                  canton of Switzerland and with the added spice of being on the Italian and Austrian borders, choosing a
                  <strong>Bernese Oberland ski holiday</strong> is definitely worth considering.</p>
