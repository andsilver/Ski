      <h1>Greenland Heli-skiing and Ski Tours</h1>
      <h2>Wild & remote - Spectacular Scenery, Icebergs, Glaciers and Fjords</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Everyone has heard of heli-skiing in Canada - afterall, it is the world's heli-skiing capital with around 80%
        of the market for this adrenaline fuelled sport. However,as the lesser known mountainous nations have started
        to promote their national assets ie mountains and ice, the areas often thought as being too remote are proving
        to be just as good and better value than the established players - Greenland, the world's largest island, is no
        exception.</p>

      <div class="flex-2">
        <p>Some of the best heli-skiing can be found on the many islands surrounding Greenland's huge coastline. These
          regions often have the deepest fjords with many permanently covered by glacial ice. On some of the decents,
          you can ski from the drop-off point, right the way down to the waters edge - something you won't experience
          when heli-skiing in the Alps.</p>

      When deciding on a heli-skiing adventure in Greenland, you have a choice of several areas each having its own
      unique characteristics. And, if you are planning on visiting several areas on your heli-skiing trip, its worth
      noting that the roads end where a city or town perimeter ends. After that, its snow, ice, mountains and fjords so
      transport is by boat, plane or helicopter.

          <p>The north slopes offer powder whilst south facing slopes deliver spring com snow. The terrain is varied

            <h3>GETTING THERE</h3>
            <h4>From Denmark</h4>
            <p>Air Greenland flies all year around from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq in West Greenland and to Narsarsuaq
              in South Greenland (summer). The flight time to either city is just 4.5 hours.</p>
            <h4>From Iceland</h4>
            <p>Air Iceland (not to be confused with Icelandair) flies from Reykjavik to Kulusuk and Nerlerit Inaat on
              Greenland's east coast. Kulusuk is served twice a week in the winter season and every day during the
              summer.</p>
            <h4>From Canada</h4>
            <p>Air Greenland flies between Nuuk and Iqaluit in Canada. From Iqaluit, there are same-day connections to
              all major cities throughout Canada including Ottawa, Vancouver, St. John's and Goose Bay.</p>

          <br>
          <p>There is huge variety and quality of terrain with drop-offs from the top of the Ice Cap to the beach! Adam

            heli-ski drop-off points, give vertical decents ranging from 600 to 1500m.</p>

            area is packed with literally hundreds of glacial runs with 2000m decents that end up at the edge of the 3
            fjords that surround this remote island.</p>

          <p>If you like "remote", this is probably as good as it gets without visiting the polar ice caps!</p>
          <h2>Getting there</h2>
          <p>The closest domestic airport is Maniitsoq which is just 50km away. However, there are no roads to
            Kangaamiut from Maniitsoq so you can either catch a boat or take a helicopter to the island. If you are
            travelling on a tour, the onwards transpot from Maniitsoq airport will be provided.</p>

            Mountain at 300m, you can see the huge icebergs that normally surround the island and beyond in to the
            Danish Straits.</p>
          <h2>Getting there</h2>
          <p>Kulusuk airport is just 40 minutes flying time from Kangerlussuaq International. Alternatively, its about

            so far north, daylight hours in the peak winter months are minimal. However, from mid May to mid August,
            its the complete opposite with the Midnight Sun from mid May to the end of July. This means heli-skiing is
            possible nearly 24 hours a day and there is nothing better than skiing virgin snow under an orange sky!</p>
          <br>
          <p>One of the best places for heli-skiing is on the Sernersuaq glacier on the Nuussuaqq peninsula.</p>
          <h2>Getting there</h2>
          <p>From Kangerlussuaq International airport, catch a flight to Qaarsut and from there, its a 10 minute ride
