        <p>Unlike many purpose-built ski resorts, Chamonix has a very buoyant summer season. During the warmer
          months you can be as active or as chilled out as you like.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Relax over lunch on a restaurant terrace gazing at the mountains views, or get a guide and get
          kitted up to go off exploring the Mer de Glace glacier with crampons and an ice pick.</p>

      <p>Each resort in the Chamonix Valley, including <a href="/resorts/les-houches">Les Houches</a> and
        <a href="/resorts/argentiere">Argentiere</a>, has lifts open during the summer season so

      <p>Our favourite outings include a walk over to Lac Blanc from La Flegere, family-friendly walks around the

        <p>Unlike many resorts, Chamonix is busier in summer than in winter so booking your holiday home in

          In summer Chamonix will be just what you want it to be with so many different things to see and do.
          You can even go rafting on the River Arve right through the centre of town – much to the amusement
          of the rest of us in town!

    <p>From Chamonix, there are many possibilities for doing day trips to neighbouring resorts - perhaps for a spot
      of lunch, shopping and sight seeing. Some of our favourites include...</p>

          <h4><a href="/regions/lake-annecy">Annecy</a></h4>
          <p>Annecy is a stunning town which resembles a smaller version of Venice with pretty waterways cutting
            through the historic centre. Lake Annecy is a cool place to hang out with lots of summer time bands
            and amusements plus you can hire a small motorboat and go for a spin around the lake. It's around a
            90 minute drive from Chamonix heading towards Geneva on the motorway and following the directions
            for Annecy.</p>

          <h4>Lake Passy</h4>
          <p>If you feel like being at the beach on a hot summers day then head down to Lake Passy. The lake is
            around a 25 minute drive to the start of the climb up to Chamonix just before you get to main town
            of Sallanches. Great for sunbathing on the white sandy beach with the snow-capped Mont Blanc in the
            background.</p>

          <p>The "boring" but
            quickest option is via the Mont Blanc Tunnel but the most memorable route is to go via Aguille du
            Midi, then across the glacier
            on the Helbonner cable car on to the Italian side of Monte Bianco, before heading down in
            to Courmayeur. The pedestrianised center boasts some of the best restaurants in the
            Aosta Valley and the window shopping is excellent with boutiques and designer shops
            lining the medieval streets...</p>
