    <h2>By plane </h2>
    <p>Chamonix is one of the most accessible summer and winter ski resorts in the Alps
      with several international airports close by and an excellent road network linking
      the major cities in both France and Italy via the Mont Blanc Tunnel that leads in
      to Courmayeur. There are many airport transfers from Geneva to Chamonix and also
      transfers from Lyon, Milan Malpensa and other airports.</p>

    <h2>By car</h2>
    <p>Chamonix is 90km away from Geneva airport taking a little over 1 hour and is literally
      straight down the Autoroute Blanche (A40) then dual carriage up the mountain in to
      the Chamonix Valley - there is not one hairpin bend!!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The A40 connects to the
      European motorway network linking in to Lyon, Grenoble, Milan, Turin and in to Switzerland. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Access is also via the Swiss town of Martigny over the pass taking approx 45 mins by car.
      Alternatively, if you fly into Turin or Milan, you can get to Chamonix via the Mont Blanc tunnel
      and takes approx 2 and 3 hours respectively.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you are landing at Geneva and hiring a car, you can pick one up on the French
      or Swiss side. The Swiss side is more expensive but the hire car does come with
      snow chains, snow tyres and road tax - on the French side, you don't get any of
      that and will need to pay CHF40 at the border control on your trip back if you get stopped.</p>

    <h2>By train</h2>

    <p>If you are arriving by train, the TGV high-speed mainline train takes you to
      St Gervais-le Fayet railway station just 20km away at the end of the A40 and then
      you switch to the local TER regional train that will take you to Chamonix.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Mont Blanc Express SNCF railway line connects all villages from St Gervais-le Fayet
      to Martigny (Switzerland) via Servoz, Les Houches, Chamonix, Argenti√®re and Vallorcine.
