        <p><strong>Skiing in Verbier - St Bernard</strong> - from its sunny plateau at 1500m looking on to Mont
          Blanc and the Grand Combin, Verbier is at the heart of Les 4 Vallées and Ski St-Bernard. A chic and
          sophisticated ski resort that is charming off the slopes but with a reputation for having some of
          the most challenging decents in the Alps.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to the skiing, Verbier hosts several international programmes such as the "Verbier
          Festival" in summer and the "Xtreme de Verbier" in winter which is the final of the Freerider World
          Tour.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Overall, Verbier is a fantastic ski resort with incredible skiing and apres-ski and thoroughly
          deserves it's international status as simply world class.</p>

        <p> With 412km of pistes serviced by 92 lifts, there is ample terrain to keep even the keenest ski
          touring enthusiast occupied where you can venture in to the resorts of:</p>
        <br>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The local Verbier ski area consists of Mont Fort, Savoleyres and Bruson. Mont Fort is the main area
          peaking at 3300m and is popular for the hard core boarders and skiers who love the many challenging
          decents from the summit. Savoleyres is more gentle than the Mont Fort with some great runs through
          the trees.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="flex-2">
        <p>The St-Bernard ski area gives a further 100km of runs which are generally much quieter than in Les 4
          Vallées. There are 5 relaxed and family orientated resorts that make up this ski area:</p>
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style: inherit; padding-left: 18px;">
          <li>
            <p>Bruson (1103m)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>La Fouly (1600m)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Champex-Lac (1486m)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Vicheres-Liddes</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Les Marecottes (1100m)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>To ski the Bruson area, you'll need to catch a bus from the centre of Verbier. Bruson has a base
          lift at 1080 which means the runs down to it tend to lose snow cover faster. However, the tree runs
          are spectacular and the area is expansive when you start to hike a bit off the beaten track.</p>

        <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: green">Beginners</h2>
        <p>Verbier has excellent nursery slopes around the village and also further up the mountain.</p>
        <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: red">Intermediate</h2>
        <p>Les 4 Valleys gives the intermediate skier ample variety with ski touring particularly good fun and
          as challenging as you want to make it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The numerous itinerary routes coming off Mont Fort should only be attempted if you are a strong
          intermediate skier or with a guide. Steeper and more challenging runs can be found around Mont Gele
          and La Chaux.</p>
        <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: #005e9c">Advanced</h2>
        <p>One of the best ski resorts in the Alps for long and extremely challenging itineraries. Combined
          with the black runs and virtually unlimited off-piste terrain, Verbier is paradise for the more
          advanced technical skiers and free riders.</p>
        <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: #646464">Snowboarding</h2>
        <p>The 4 valleys offers the snowboarder a serious amount of terrain to freeride and some fantastic long
          off-piste itineraries to test the stamina.</p>

        <p>The <strong>accommodation in Verbier</strong> caters for all tastes and budgets although there is
          more of the high end ski chalets and hi-spec apartments to rent than in some other resorts with
          prices to match. As Verbier has expanded over the years, the residences and ski chalets have been
          creeping steadily away from the centre, both up and down the slopes giving more choice and variety
          with some of the properties now offering door-step skiing.</p>

      <li>
        <p>New Years Eve in Verbier is not to be missed. The town centre is transformed into a massive party
          with live music and fireworks going off until the early hours - seriously good fun and one of the
          best places in the Alps to bring in the New Year</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>During the school holidays, Verbier gets extremely busy and from past experience, we strongly
          recommend booking your chosen restaurant for lunch and dinner a few days in advance if possible</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>During the children's holidays, the pistes in Les 4 Vallées tend to get a little crowded and thats
          when we go over to the St-Bernard area of Champex-Lac. 65% of the runs are Red so is ideal for the
          intermediate skier and there are some cracking runs such as the scenic decent through the Arpette
          Valley</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Haute Route, linking <a href="/resorts/chamonix">Chamonix</a> to
          <a href="/resorts/zermatt">Zermatt</a> passes
          through the 4 Valleys and is definitely well worth the trip. This is not only spectacular and
          demanding tour
          staying overnight in the mountain refugees but a unique and unforgettable experience.</p>
