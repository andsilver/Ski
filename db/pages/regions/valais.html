        <p><strong>Ski holidays in Valais</strong> - the canton is one of Switzerland's most popular
          destinations when it comes to alpine sports boasting some of the highest mountains in the Alps.
          Surrounded by 4,000m peaks, Valais is the ideal place to relax, have fun and enjoy the spectacular
          scenery. Sitting in southern Switzerland, Valais is home to the famous Matterhorn mountain, chic
          and cosmopolitan ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans Montana plus the vineyards of the upper
          Rhône River Valley.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The Valais is also laced with hidden gems where many ski resorts are not even on the radar, even in
          Switzerland! Val d'Anniviers and Val d’Hérens boast some of the most picteresque villages in the
          canton such as Grimentz and Evolene. With the blackened timber of their raccards (granaries),
          chalets and barns that line the narrow cobbled street, you feel you are in a place that time
          forgot.</p>

        <p>The ski area enjoys exceptionally good snowfall from mid-November to the end of April, with an average of
          nearly 7m of powder every year.</p>
        <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: green">Beginners</h2>
        <p>The extent and variety of the beginner terrain across the Valais ski resorts is superb. Anzere, for example,
          has long, gentle beginner slopes for learning the basics with a magic carpet straight from the village square
          linking to the beginner slopes.</p>
        <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: red">Intermediate</h2>
        <p>The wealth of terrain means that intermediates will find plenty of suitable trails across all the Valais
          resorts. Verbier and the 4 Valleys is the largest ski area and has enough terrain to last a life time whereas
          Saas Fee and Zermatt have fantastic intermediate pistes at high altitude.</p>
        <h2 style="width: 100%; padding: 12px; color: #005e9c">Advanced</h2>
        <p>Expert skiers are in for a treat in Valais as the high peaks provide some of Switzerland's best steeps. From
          the glaciers at Zermatt, Saas Fee and Atletsch to the off-piste touring on Mont Fort at Verbier, Valais
          certainly caters for the extreme skiers and boarders. When you add in the heli-skiing opportunities on the
          4000m peaks around the Matterhorn and the giant Dent Blanche (4357m) at the end of Val d’Héren, there is more
          terrain can you can cover in a lifetime.</p>
