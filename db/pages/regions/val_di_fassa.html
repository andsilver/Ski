      <p class="text-left"><strong>Marmolada</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>Skiing on the Marmolada is not to be missed - from Arabba it takes around 40 mins skiing to the base cable car
        and then a further 2 cable cars to get to the top. The best known run is the Bellunese from Punta Rocca at
        3300m down to Malga Ciapela, a vertical drop of 1800m and 12km long - truly amazing and stunning scenery all
        the way.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Also on the Marmolada, you can ski the Great War Tour. Between 1915 and 1918, Austrian and Italian troops
        fought on and around the Marmolada. They dug ice caves for shelter which can still be visited today.
