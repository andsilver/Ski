                    <p><strong>Skiing in Verbier - St Bernard</strong> - from its sunny plateau at 1500m looking on to Mont
                        Blanc and the Grand Combin, Verbier is at the heart of Les 4 Vallées and Ski St-Bernard. A chic and
                        sophisticated ski resort that is charming off the slopes but with a reputation for having some of
                        the most challenging decents in the Alps.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition to the skiing, Verbier hosts several international programmes such as the "Verbier
                        Festival" in summer and the "Xtreme de Verbier" in winter which is the final of the Freerider World
                        Tour.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overall, Verbier is a fantastic ski resort with incredible skiing and apres-ski and thoroughly
                        deserves it's international status as simply world class.</p>

                    <p>The local Verbier ski area consists of Mont Fort, Savoleyres and Bruson. Mont Fort is the main area
                        peaking at 3300m and is popular for the hard core boarders and skiers who love the many challenging
                        decents from the summit. Savoleyres is more gentle than the Mont Fort with some great runs through
                        the trees.</p>

                    <p>To ski the Bruson area, you'll need to catch a bus from the centre of Verbier. Bruson has a base
                        lift at 1080 which means the runs down to it tend to lose snow cover faster. However, the tree runs
                        are spectacular and the area is expansive when you start to hike a bit off the beaten track.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The numerous itinerary routes coming off Mont Fort should only be attempted if you are a strong
                        intermediate skier or with a guide. Steeper and more challenging runs can be found around Mont Gele
                        and La Chaux.</p>

                    <p>New Years Eve in Verbier is not to be missed. The town centre is transformed into a massive party
                        with live music and fireworks going off until the early hours - seriously good fun and one of the

                    <p>During the school holidays, Verbier gets extremely busy and from past experience, we strongly
                        recommend booking your chosen restaurant for lunch and dinner a few days in advance if possible</p>

                    <p>During the children's holidays, the pistes in Les 4 Vallées tend to get a little crowded and thats
                        when we go over to the St-Bernard area of Champex-Lac. 65% of the runs are Red so is ideal for the
                        intermediate skier and there are some cracking runs such as the scenic decent through the Arpette
                        Valley</p>

                        through the 4 Valleys and is definitely well worth the trip. This is not only spectacular and

                        staying overnight in the mountain refugees but a unique and unforgettable experience.</p>

                      <p>In terms of the ski accommodation in Verbier, there is a myth that the prices are in the
                          stratosphere. Whilst there are luxurious ski chalets and apartments that are very expensive, there
                          are many places that wont break the bank.</p>

                      <p>Wherever you choose to stay in Valais, whether a holiday rental in the Rhone Valley or in one of the
                          charming ski resort, the scenery is spectacular and you are never far from the ski lifts and local
                          apres-ski bars and restaurants. The other major benefit of renting a holiday home is that they
                          provide the
                          freedom, flexibility and space to do what you want, when you want - ideal for familes, groups and
