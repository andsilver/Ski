  <p><strong>Ski holidays in France</strong> are very popular as the Alps are home to undoubtedly some of the best
    and most extensive ski terrain in the world and when you add in the Pyrenees, France boasts more than 400 ski
    resorts!</p>
  <br>
  <p>Skiing in the French ski resorts - these vary considerably from the small, charming and traditional to the
    large, cosmopolitan and commercialised. There is something for everyone from quaint, family friendly resorts to
    those that cater for the younger crowd meaning the apres-ski kicks-off early and finishes very late!</p>

  <h2>Featured French Ski Regions & Ski Carousels</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Most of the well known French ski resorts are located on the borders to Switzerland and Italy which is where you
    find the huge lift linked areas such as the Portes du Soleil, Grand Massif and Les Trois Vallees.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Whilst many French ski resorts are geared up for beginners and intermediates, there are some, and Chamonix
    springs to mind, where not only will you find the gentle slopes, but also some of the best and steepest off-piste
    terrain in the world.</p>
