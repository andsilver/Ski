    <br>
    <p><strong>Swiss ski holidays</strong> make you think of chocolate box ski chalets, great service and
      efficient transport both on and off the slopes - it's all true! With world famous Swiss ski resorts
      such as Verbier, Zermatt and St Moritz, high mountains and stunning lakes, summer or winter holidays in
      Switzerland provide a large variety of activities for everyone....</p>
    <br>
    <p>Getting to most of the Swiss ski resorts is fairly quick and easy especially if you are skiing in
      Valais. Sion airport is ideally positioned to get you on the mountain in under an hour! See our <a href="/pages/ski-resorts-switzerland">ski
        resorts in Switzerland</a> page for more information on airport transfer distances.</p>

    <h1>Switzerland Ski Holiday Rentals</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The <strong>Swiss ski resorts</strong> certainly have an excellent variety of accommodation including
      luxurious spa hotels. If you are looking for somewhere to stay, there is plenty of choice. Many owners
      choose to offer their properties as holiday rentals throughout the year which can mean renting a
      chocolate-box ski chalet, town house or an apartment. Depending on which resort you choose, many
      holiday rentals offer ski-in / ski-out which makes life so much easier especially if you are travelling
      with a young family.</p>

  <div class="page-description">
    <h1>Twin Centre - Lakes & Ski Holidays</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The other major attraction are the lakes. <strong>Lake Geneva</strong> is probably the best known but
      there are many more such as <a href="/regions/lake-thun">Lake Thun</a> and <a href="/regions/lake-brienz">Lake
        Brienz</a> near Interlaken. Here, you are very close to the ski resorts of <strong>Grindelwald</strong>
      and <strong>Wengen</strong> meaning you can combine a ski holiday with some time around the lakes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Swiss lakes are a very popular summer holiday destination visited by people from all over the world
      - this is because of the magnificent mountain vistas, excellent service, top class international
      cuisine and first rate accommodation.</p>

    <h1>Ski Resorts in Switzerland</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Switzerland has many top class international ski resorts, some of which are famed for their spas, others
      for their opulance and some just because the skiing is simply worldclass. This diversity of ski resorts
      makes Switzerland such a big attraction as they cater for all levels, families, groups and non-skiers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With the ski season typically lasting a good five months from early November in the higher resorts
      through to April, Swiss ski holidays offer relaible snow conditions but also great food and superb
      levels of service both on and off the slopes.</p>

        <h2>Summer in the Swiss Alps</h2>
        <p>Visiting this mountainous country during the summer seems to be getting more and more popular as a holiday
          destination. Mountain biking, hiking and watersports on the lakes have always been big attractions but these
          days, many of the Swiss ski resorts have reinvented themselves as top summer holiday resorts. They provide an
          ever increasing number of activities and children's clubs so that there is something for all the family.'</p>

        <h2>Swiss Summer Skiing Holidays</h2>
        <p>There are several ski resorts that offer summer skiing on the glaciers. The best terrain can be found at <a
            href="/resorts/zermatt">Zermatt</a> and <a href="/resorts/saas-fee">Saas Fee</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Zermatt is open throughout the year and even in the height of summer, you can still cruise around on 20km of
          pistes. Saas Fee is very similar offering 20km of pistes on the Allalin Glacier at 3600m where you will often
          find the Swiss ski team training.
